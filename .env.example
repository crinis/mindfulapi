# Environment Configuration Example

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=

# Server Port
PORT=3000

# Base URL for the application (used for screenshot URLs)
# Should be set to your actual domain in production
# BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com

# Browser Configuration
# =====================

# External Chromium CDP connection (optional)
# If set, connects to external Chromium instance via Chrome DevTools Protocol
# If not set, launches local headless Chromium instance
# 
# Using external browser service reduces container size and isolates browser processes
# Useful for:
# - Dedicated browser containers in Docker Compose
# - Cloud browser services  
# - Kubernetes browser pods
# - Development with separate browser instances
#
# Example values:
# CHROMIUM_CDP_URL=ws://chromium:9222
# CHROMIUM_CDP_URL=ws://localhost:9222
# CHROMIUM_CDP_URL=ws://browser-service.internal:9222

# Database Configuration
# For production, consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL
# For Docker deployments, use /data/database.sqlite with volume mounting
# For development, uses local data directory
DATABASE_PATH=./data/database.sqlite

# Screenshot Configuration
# Directory where accessibility issue screenshots will be stored
# For production, consider using absolute paths or cloud storage
# For Docker deployments, use /data/screenshots with volume mounting
# For development, uses local data directory
SCREENSHOT_DIR=./data/screenshots

# Cleanup Service Configuration
# =============================

# Enable or disable automatic cleanup (default: true)
# Set to 'false' to disable scheduled cleanup jobs
CLEANUP_ENABLED=true

# Cleanup schedule using cron expression (default: daily at 2:00 AM)
# Production recommendation: Run during low-traffic hours
# Examples:
# - Every day at 2:00 AM: 0 2 * * *
# - Every Sunday at 3:00 AM: 0 3 * * 0
# - Every 6 hours: 0 */6 * * *
CLEANUP_INTERVAL=0 2 * * *

# Number of days to retain scans before cleanup (default: 30)
# Production recommendation: 90 days for compliance and analytics
# Scans older than this many days will be deleted along with their issues
CLEANUP_RETENTION_DAYS=90

# Performance tuning for large-scale deployments
# Batch size for processing scans and files (default: 1000)
# Production recommendation: 500-2000 depending on server resources
CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE=1000

# Concurrency limit for parallel file operations (default: 10)
# Production recommendation: 5-15 based on filesystem and server capacity
CLEANUP_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=10

# Logging
# Production recommendation: 'info' or 'warn' to reduce log volume
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Authentication Token for API access
# SECURITY: Change this to a strong, unique token in production
AUTH_TOKEN=your-secure-api-token-here
