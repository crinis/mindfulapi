/**
 * Cleanup service for managing scan data retention and screenshot file cleanup.
 * 
 * This service provides automated cleanup of old accessibility scans, their associated
 * issues, and screenshot files to prevent unlimited storage growth. It runs on a
 * configurable schedule and respects configurable retention periods for data management.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Configurable retention period for scans and related data
 * - Configurable cleanup interval via cron expressions
 * - Automatic screenshot file cleanup from filesystem
 * - Database cascade deletion for scans and issues
 * - Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
 * - Environment variable configuration for flexible deployment
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - CLEANUP_ENABLED: Enable/disable automatic cleanup (default: true)
 * - CLEANUP_INTERVAL: Cron expression for cleanup schedule (default: daily at 2 AM)
 * - CLEANUP_RETENTION_DAYS: Days to retain scans before cleanup (default: 30)
 *   Special case: When set to 0, enables test mode that cleans up ALL existing scans
 * - SCREENSHOT_DIR: Directory where screenshots are stored (default: ./screenshots)
 * 
 * The service performs cleanup in two phases:
 * 1. Database cleanup: Removes scans older than retention period (cascade deletes issues)
 * 2. File cleanup: Removes orphaned screenshot files from filesystem
